# Data_Analysis--Hotel_Booking

The problem statement here was, city & resort hotels have seen high cancellation rates. This is leading to less revenue & less than ideal room use. Hypothesis is, more cancellations occur when prices are high & when there is a longer waiting list. For this analysis, Python & libraries(NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SeaBorn) were used. After importing the CSV file, cleaning was needed for the raw data to become fit to draw insights for visualizations. Analysis, Cleaning & Visualizations were some of the key steps & we even provided solutions to the problem mentioned above.
